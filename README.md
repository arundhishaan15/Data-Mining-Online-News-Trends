# Data-Mining-Online-News-Trends

In this project top 20 online trending articles about Indian National News were taken from four popular News Channels: Wall Street Journal, Times of India, Hindustan Times and Then Indian Express.

Tokenization and bi-grams are used to initially understand the most common news by the newspaper. Further, the sentiment analysis is done using the ‘nrc’ dictionary in R. We would visualize the results using bar charts and word clouds. Also, Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (tf-idf) is used to find the unique words from articles of these Newspapers that gives us the insight of how these Newspapers are different in their focus to pick specific News.
